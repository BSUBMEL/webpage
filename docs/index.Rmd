**Sophia Theodossiou, Ph.D.**

sophiatheodossiou@boisestate.edu 

Sophia was raised in Athens, Greece, and was fascinated from an early age by how living things work. She completed her BA in Human Biology and Anthropology at Northwestern University in 2012. Following a series of odd jobs (taxi driver, IHOP server, a 3 year stint in the outdoor industry, EMT), she returned to graduate school and completed her PhD in Biological Engineering at the University of Idaho, graduating in the totally normal, not at all unprecedented year of 2020. Sophia spent 2020-2022 in Boston as an NIH IRACDA Postdoctoral Scholar at Tufts University, and a T32 Organ Design and Engineering Training Program Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. In August 2022, she returned to the great state of Idaho as an Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at Boise State University, and founded the Biomaterials and Musculoskeletal Engineering Lab, or BMEL ("BEE-mehl"). Research in BMEL seeks to understand how mechanical and biochemical signals guide musculoskeletal tissue formation during normal development, with the goal of using developmentally-inspired cues to regenerate these tissues following injury or disease. When not happily engaged in research, mentoring, teaching, or grant writing, you'll find Sophia (and usually one or more of her dogs) mountain biking, trail running, backcountry or downhill skiing, backpacking, camping, cooking, traveling, reading, unsuccessfully gardening, teaching wilderness medicine courses, volunteering for search & rescue, and sailing between uninhabited islands in her beloved Aegean sea.

**Brian Penney** 

brianpenney@u.boisestate.edu

Brian was born in Omaha, Nebraska and grew up in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Brian graduated from the University of Idaho in 2022 with his Bachelor's of Science in Biological Engineering. His undergraduate research focused on biochemical injury factors in tendon. He began his Biomedical Engineering Doctorate in BMEL at BSU in the Fall of 2022. Brian's research focuses on better understanding the early stages of Osteoarthritis pathogenesis in regards to mechanical alterations in the affected cartilage using models comprised of chondrocytes, macrophages and dynamically stiffening silk scaffolds. He also is using silk microneedle patches for drug delivery with cargo like antifreeze proteins for frostbite treatment and genetically engineered probiotics for neurotransmitter production or inhibition. Outside of research, Brian is an avid rock climber and biker.

**Calvin Jones**

calvinjones@u.boisestate.edu 

Calvin was born and raised in El Paso, Texas. In 2021, Calvin graduated from Texas A&M University (WHOOP!) with a Bachelor's of Science in Biomedical Engineering. After graduation, Calvin worked as a research assistant for a spinal cord injury lab at the Texas A&M Health Science Center. Calvin joined BMEL in the fall of 2022 and began his doctorate in Biomedical Engineering at Boise State University. Calvin's research focuses on understanding the nanomechanical properties of novel biomaterials. Furthermore, Calvin seeks to better understand how those properties can be modulated to selectively direct the differentiation of cells in aims to improve regenerative therapies of complex musculoskeletal tissues. In his free time, Calvin enjoys watching sports, spending time with friends and family, and exploring the outdoors.

**Sourjja Deep**

sourjjadeep@u.boisestate.edu 

Sourjjadeepta Biswas, typically known as Sourjja Deep, hails from Bangladesh and earned his Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from NIT Surat in India. After his time in the industry in Bangladesh, he joined the Mechanical Engineering masterâ€™s program for the fall 2023 at Boise State University in Idaho, USA. Far from home, his passion for biology and a personal experience with a fractured forearm have fueled his commitment to musculoskeletal engineering. His goal is to develop cutting-edge custom biomaterials and innovative medical devices to contribute to his lab's research in biomedical engineering. In his free time, apart from his usual human activities, he likes to gaze upon the stars and contemplate over the vast continuum of time and space.

```

**Jordan** 

jordandaw@u.boisestate.edu

Jordan was born in Boise, Idaho. In May of 2023, Jordan graduated from Boise State University with a Bachelor of Science in Biology and two minors in Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering. During her final semester at Boise State University, Jordan joined BMEL and has continued to work in the lab after graduation for preparation of her future endeavors towards medical school. Jordan helps PhD and Master students with their research projects wherever needed. In her time outside of the lab, Jordan enjoys spending time with family, friends, and pets, doing anything outdoors, and making art.

## Undergraduates:

```

**Skyler Kichak**

Skyler was born in Morgantown, West Virginia and grew up in Boise, Idaho. Skyler is in his third year of Engineering +, pursuing minors in Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry and Applied Mathematics. Immersion when problem solving has been an integral part of Skyler's education; a good solution comes from a holistic understanding of the problem itself. It has always been his dream to change lives and have a little fun along the way. In supporting his dream, Skyler has worked in various kitchens across the valley and finds it an enjoyable way to support his education. Outside of school, Skyler enjoys long hikes and spending time with family.

```

**Tawa Giwa**

Tawa Giwa is originally from the vibrant city of Lagos, Nigeria. Currently, Tawa is in the third year of her educational adventure, working towards a degree in mechanical engineering, with an intriguing twist - a minor in Biomedical Engineering. From a young age, Tawa has been fascinated by the intricate workings of machines and the endless possibilities they offer. This fascination led Tawa to choose mechanical engineering as my field of study, where she's been exposed to a world of design, innovation, and problem-solving. Simultaneously, Tawa's minor in Biomedical Engineering allows her to explore the fascinating intersection between technology and healthcare, where she hopes to make a meaningful impact in the future. Away from the world of academia, Tawa has a rather unique hobby - exploring the global culinary landscape. Food, for her, is not just sustenance; it's a passport to different cultures and traditions. Whether she's savoring the intricate flavors of Asian cuisine or indulging in the comforting familiarity of home-cooked meals, Tawa is always excited to explore new tastes and experiences.

**Taylor Izzard**

Taylor was born in Everett, Washington and raised in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. In Spring 2023, he graduated from North Idaho College with an Associate Degree in General Studies. Taylor is in his first year of studying Kinesiology with an emphasis in Neuromechanical Science while also pursuing a Biomedical Engineering Minor. He loves to constantly learn as much as possible about everything he can, whether that be inside or outside of his formal education. A career in biology has always been on his radar, and being in BMEL allows him to learn how a lab works while simultaneously contributing to meaningful research. Outside of education, Taylor loves getting outside regardless of the weather or other conditions. During the summers, he works for a whitewater fishing guide company on the Deschutes River, Oregon. The few times that he is not able to get outside, Taylor still loves to learn a variety of skills such as sewing, the German language, daydreaming, and music.
