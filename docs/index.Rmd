**Calvin Jones**

calvinjones@u.boisestate.edu 

Calvin was born and raised in El Paso, Texas. In 2021, Calvin graduated from Texas A&M University (WHOOP!) with a Bachelor's of Science in Biomedical Engineering. After graduation, Calvin worked as a research assistant for a spinal cord injury lab at the Texas A&M Health Science Center. Calvin joined BMEL in the fall of 2022 and began his doctorate in Biomedical Engineering at Boise State University. Calvin's research focuses on understanding the nanomechanical properties of novel biomaterials, and how those properties can be modulated to selectively direct the differentiation of cells in aims to improve regenerative therapies of complex musculoskeletal tissues. In his free time, Calvin enjoys watching sports, spending time with friends and family, and exploring the outdoors.

**Jordan** 

Jordan was born in Boise, Idaho. In May of 2023, Jordan graduated from Boise State University with a Bachelor of Science in Biology and two minors in Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering. During her final semester at Boise State University, Jordan joined BMEL and has continued to work in the lab after graduation for preparation of her future endeavors towards medical school. Jordan helps PhD and Master students with their research projects wherever needed. In her time outside of the lab, Jordan enjoys spending time with family, friends, and pets, doing anything outdoors, and making art.
