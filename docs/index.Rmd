**Calvin Jones**

calvinjones@u.boisestate.edu 

Calvin was born and raised in El Paso, Texas. In 2021, Calvin graduated from Texas A&M University (WHOOP!) with a Bachelor's of Science in Biomedical Engineering. After graduation, Calvin worked as a research assistant for a spinal cord injury lab at the Texas A&M Health Science Center. Calvin joined BMEL in the fall of 2022 and began his doctorate in Biomedical Engineering at Boise State University. Calvin's research focuses on understanding the nanomechanical properties of novel biomaterials, and how those properties can be modulated to selectively direct the differentiation of cells in aims to improve regenerative therapies of complex musculoskeletal tissues. In his free time, Calvin enjoys watching sports, spending time with friends and family, and exploring the outdoors.
