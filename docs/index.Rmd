<!--# [**Research**]{.underline}-->

**BMEL combines the use natural and synthetic biomaterials along with human and non-human stem cells to develop 3D models of musculoskeletal development and disease, with the ultimate goal of regenerating musculoskeletal tissues following injury or disease.**

**Research in BMEL combines engineering, biology, and materials science to understand how mechanical and biochemical signals drive musculoskeletal development, maturation, and disease. BMEL uses various materials and custom, 3D printed bioreactors and scaffolds to understand how biomechanical cues can be harnessed to regenerate and repair musculoskeletal tissues.**

**Sophia Theodossiou, Ph.D.**

sophiatheodossiou@boisestate.edu 

Sophia was raised in Athens, Greece, and was fascinated from an early age by how living things work. She completed her BA in Human Biology and Anthropology at Northwestern University in 2012. Following a series of odd jobs (taxi driver, IHOP server, a 3 year stint in the outdoor industry, EMT), she returned to graduate school and completed her PhD in Biological Engineering at the University of Idaho, graduating in the totally normal, not at all unprecedented year of 2020. Sophia spent 2020-2022 in Boston as an NIH IRACDA Postdoctoral Scholar at Tufts University, and a T32 Organ Design and Engineering Training Program Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. In August 2022, she returned to the great state of Idaho as an Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at Boise State University, and founded the Biomaterials and Musculoskeletal Engineering Lab, or BMEL ("BEE-mehl"). Research in BMEL seeks to understand how mechanical and biochemical signals guide musculoskeletal tissue formation during normal development, with the goal of using developmentally-inspired cues to regenerate these tissues following injury or disease. When not happily engaged in research, mentoring, teaching, or grant writing, you'll find Sophia (and usually one or more of her dogs) mountain biking, trail running, backcountry or downhill skiing, backpacking, camping, cooking, traveling, reading, unsuccessfully gardening, teaching wilderness medicine courses, volunteering for search & rescue, and sailing between uninhabited islands in her beloved Aegean sea.

**Brian Penney** 

brianpenney@u.boisestate.edu

Brian was born in Omaha, Nebraska and grew up in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Brian graduated from the University of Idaho in 2022 with his Bachelor's of Science in Biological Engineering. His undergraduate research focused on biochemical injury factors in tendon. He began his Biomedical Engineering Doctorate in BMEL at BSU in the Fall of 2022. Brian's research focuses on better understanding the early stages of Osteoarthritis pathogenesis in regards to mechanical alterations in the affected cartilage using models comprised of chondrocytes, macrophages and dynamically stiffening silk scaffolds. He also is using silk microneedle patches for drug delivery with cargo like antifreeze proteins for frostbite treatment and genetically engineered probiotics for neurotransmitter production or inhibition. Outside of research, Brian is an avid rock climber and biker.

**Dante Calarco**

Dante was born and raised in Chico, CA. After high school, Dante did two years at Butte College for pre-med before transferring to Boise State as a Mechanical Engineering student while also pursuing a minor in Biomedical Engineering. Dante has always been interested in the STEM field, however his interest in engineering and biomechanics grew through football and wrestling injuries, as well working in various manual labor jobs. His experiences have lead him to the goal of becoming an engineer working on medical devices, advanced prosthetics, or ergonomic design. Outside of school, Dante likes to spend time with friends and family, hiking, fishing, and working out.

**Skyler Kichak**

Skyler was born in Morgantown, West Virginia and grew up in Boise, Idaho. Skyler is in his third year of Engineering +, pursuing minors in Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry and Applied Mathematics. Immersion when problem solving has been an integral part of Skyler's education; a good solution comes from a holistic understanding of the problem itself. It has always been his dream to change lives and have a little fun along the way. In supporting his dream, Skyler has worked in various kitchens across the valley and finds it an enjoyable way to support his education. Outside of school, Skyler enjoys long hikes and spending time with family.

**Tawa Giwa**

Tawa Giwa is originally from the vibrant city of Lagos, Nigeria. Currently, Tawa is in the third year of her educational adventure, working towards a degree in mechanical engineering, with an intriguing twist - a minor in Biomedical Engineering. From a young age, Tawa has been fascinated by the intricate workings of machines and the endless possibilities they offer. This fascination led Tawa to choose mechanical engineering as my field of study, where she's been exposed to a world of design, innovation, and problem-solving. Simultaneously, Tawa's minor in Biomedical Engineering allows her to explore the fascinating intersection between technology and healthcare, where she hopes to make a meaningful impact in the future. Away from the world of academia, Tawa has a rather unique hobby - exploring the global culinary landscape. Food, for her, is not just sustenance; it's a passport to different cultures and traditions. Whether she's savoring the intricate flavors of Asian cuisine or indulging in the comforting familiarity of home-cooked meals, Tawa is always excited to explore new tastes and experiences.

**Taylor Izzard**

Taylor was born in Everett, Washington and raised in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. In Spring 2023, he graduated from North Idaho College with an Associate Degree in General Studies. Taylor is in his first year of studying Kinesiology with an emphasis in Neuromechanical Science while also pursuing a Biomedical Engineering Minor. He loves to constantly learn as much as possible about everything he can, whether that be inside or outside of his formal education. A career in biology has always been on his radar, and being in BMEL allows him to learn how a lab works while simultaneously contributing to meaningful research. Outside of education, Taylor loves getting outside regardless of the weather or other conditions. During the summers, he works for a whitewater fishing guide company on the Deschutes River, Oregon. The few times that he is not able to get outside, Taylor still loves to learn a variety of skills such as sewing, the German language, daydreaming, and music.

**Jonathan Netter** 

Jonathan was born and raised in Sonoma, California. He completed his Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Bioengineering: pre-medical at the University of California at San Diego. After receiving his degree, he worked in an orthopedic lab quantifying material wear for total knee and hip prosthetic implants. He also developed computer models which validated the experiments to predict wear rates in future untested designs. After helping a few patients in the lab, Jonathan decided he wanted to pursue a career in medicine to have more of these interactions helping patients. Currently, he is finalizing his first year of medical school at Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine. Grounded in research, Jonathan hopes to bridge the gap from the lab bench to the clinic to offer novel and effective solutions to existing medical problems. He is particularly interested in understanding cartilage injury and repair mechanisms.
